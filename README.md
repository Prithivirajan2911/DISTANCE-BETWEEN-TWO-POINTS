# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Using import math function,do the calculations.
### Step 2: 
Assign the values of point 1 and point 2 whose distance is to be calculated.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
using the print function, display the distance between the two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
x1,y1=4,2
x2,y2=10,6
result=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(result))
```

### OUTPUT:
![output](/distance%20between%20the%20points.png)

### RESULT:
Thus the distance between two points are successfully executed.
